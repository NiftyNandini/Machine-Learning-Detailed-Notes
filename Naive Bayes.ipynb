    "### Why is it called Naïve Bayes?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Naïve Bayes algorithm is composed of two key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naïve**: The term \"naïve\" is used because the algorithm **assumes that all features are independent** of each other. In other words, the presence or absence of one feature does not affect the presence or absence of another. \n",
    "- **For example :** if a fruit is identified by color, shape, and taste, the algorithm considers each characteristic (like \"red,\" \"spherical,\" \"sweet\") independently when classifying it as an apple.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bayes**: The term \"Bayes\" refers to the use of **Bayes' Theorem**, a mathematical formula used to calculate probabilities and update them based on new information.\n"
